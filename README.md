# PoP Machine Glow

### Introducing "proof of puzzle"...All your answers are ~~belong~~ _unknown_ to us

PoP Machine Glow (PoPMG) is a zero knowledge encryption oracle and DApp that provides users and puzzle authors verifiable proof of passing a test. It verifies that your user knows the correct answer to a question without revealing what the question or its answers might be.

Storage of puzzle answers is handled by the Oracle smart contract. This contract stores the Puzzle ID and its associated answers in a Michelson record type:

Example (Ligo / Pascal)

```
type Puzzle is
  record [
    id      	  : nat;      // e.g. Creation Time
    author  	  : address;  // Author address
    public_h 	  : bytes;    // Encrypted bytes output of hashing contract (public)
    rewards_h 	: bytes;      // Encrypted bytes output of hashing contract (rewards)
    rewards 	  : nat       // Max claimable rewards (default 0)
                              // Suggested max rewards capacity: testnet (10), mainnet (100)
  ]
```

Example 2 - creating a new puzzle record:

```
const new_puzzle_record : Puzzle =
  record [
    id      	= 1583093350498n;
    author  	= authorAddress;
    public_h 	= encryptedOutput;
    rewards_h	= operationOutput;
    rewards = 3n   // e.g. NFTs locked to First, Second and Third place claimants
  ]
```

# The Basic Gist

The *Oracle Contract* is the main worker for handling storage from the puzzle's Author and manages the event queue for verifying results from a puzzle's players. Encryption of plain text strings (the answers) must be handled client side to ensure a puzzle's solutions are kept a secret and won't become publicly accessible once the puzzle entry is stored.

To encrypt the answers we'll store access to our primitives and cipher operations in a different smart contract, we call this the *Hashing Contract*, and its cipher operations are callable without any gas payment. This allows an author to generate encrypted bytes data to send to storage in the Oracle contract without needing to `POST` sensitive data over `HTTP` or store it in the contract. It also allows a puzzle's players to verify they've got a correct set of answers for free, but if they want to reap some of the creator's sweet rewards they will need to fund the contract with a small amount of XTZ so it can perform operations on their behalf.

The *Hashing Contract* uses its public key + the Oracle contract's public key for encryption operations. This resulting key is visible and calculable by everyone but that's what enables all parties involved (Author, Oracle and Player) to call the contract independently to check if they've got the correct answers for free. In addition to the public hash, a rewards claim hash is also produced if the total NFT rewards quantity is greater than 0. The rewards hash is generated by passing the answers through multiple rounds of encryption equal to the total rewards quantity + 1, and to claim any reward Players are required to prove they have the correct answers by generating the hashes of previous encryptions rounds. This Zero Knowledge encryption strategy is called "proving age with hash chains".

# What About Rewards? 

Now that we have our Zero Knowledge protocol for answer verification, we get to do cool stuff with it. More importantly, we can reward players for finding correct answers. This requires inheriting a third contract, we can call this the *Rewards contract* which contains code for minting NFTs according to the proposed Tezos NFT standards. 

### Reward Rules
- User must have a verified solution set (correct answers)
- User can only obtain an NFT reward if there's a claimable quanitity remaining in storage. If a reward is claimed the `rewards: int` property of the `Puzzle` record gets decremented when the reward has been sent to the winner.

*Note: in order to be processed securely the Rewards contract needs to be locked so that it can only be called by the Hashing Contract. If it's called by other source the transaction needs to be automatically rejected.*

# Getting More In Depth

## Creation
1) Puzzle Author encrypts the puzzle answers by calling Hashing Contract client side (Client): `Sha-256((Oracle Public Key + Hasher Public Key) + Answers) => Encrypted Bytes`
	- This is the publicly verifiable hash that can be checked by players calling the Hashing contract for free
2) If more than 0 rewards, Author encrypts the puzzle answers again by calling the rewards hash generator of the Hashing Contract client side (Client)
	- The rewards hash is generated by encrypting the answers again multiple times. 
	- The amount of encryption rounds at creation is equal to the total max NFT rewards + 1 and this is verified by the Hashing Contract during creation
3) Author submits create puzzle transaction with Public (and Rewards hash if applicable). Author pays their own storage.

## Verification
1) Users submit their answers to the DApp which calls the Hashing contract to test. Can proceed to next step if solutions are correct and output hash matches the Oracle contract storage (Client)
2) If NFT rewards are available, and a User has the correct set of answers, they can send a transaction to rewards claim function to claim a reward (Hasing Contract / Oracle Contract)
	- Note: rewards are computationally expensive proportionate to claim order
3) To obtain an NFT reward and proof of puzzle completion claimants verify their answers with the help of the Hashing Contract Prover to solve a hash puzzle in a specific order (Client):
	- Since the rewards hash is encrypted with rounds equal to Quantity + 1, the first solver calls the Prover to generate the hashes of previous rounds
	- Lower round rewards are more computationally expensive for the prover. If the first claim hash is Rewards hash - 1 round, than claiming rewards is slightly more expensive for subsequent solvers. If the reverse claim order is used, the first place prize becomes the most expensive transaction.
